# OpenBazaar Crawler

### The Challenge

Using Go write an OpenBazaar network crawler that logs the total number of listings on the network. The crawler may connect to a running openbazaar-go instance and use the API.

You can find the API code here: https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/tree/master/api

Some endpoints of interest may be:
- /ob/peers
- /ob/closestpeers
- /ob/profile
- /ob/listings
